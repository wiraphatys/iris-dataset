# Iris Classification Project
This project implements a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into different species based on the famous Iris dataset.

# About the Project
This project serves as an introduction to machine learning classification using the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for educational purposes. The goal is to predict the species of iris flowers based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
